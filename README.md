# Wi-Fi Attacks: Brute-Force & Fuzzing with Raspberry Pi

This repository contains two practical security exercises developed for the course *Mobile and Wireless Network Security* at the University of the Aegean. It includes:

- A brute-force login simulation against a router's admin panel using a **Raspberry Pi Pico W** as a USB HID device.
- A fuzzing campaign using **WPAxFuzz** to analyze the resilience of Wi-Fi management frames on Access Points and Stations.

## ðŸ”’ Project 1: Brute-Force via Raspberry Pi Pico W

- Uses CircuitPython and `adafruit_hid` to simulate keyboard input.
- Performs login attempts via Chromium browser on a Linux machine.
- Sends successful credential pair to a remote server using `curl`.

## ðŸ“¡ Project 2: Wi-Fi Management Frame Fuzzing with WPAxFuzz

- Targets Beacon, Probe Request, Association Request/Response, and Authentication frames.
- Observed stability issues in STA devices and packet rejection behavior.
- Collected `.pcap` files and analyzed results with Wireshark.

## ðŸ§  Threat Modeling

The project includes a threat model based on the **Security Cards framework**.

ðŸ“„ See: [`threat-model.md`](./threat-model.md)
